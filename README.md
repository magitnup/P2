# MATCH'EM!

- This simple memory game, was inspired by the card game we propably all played when we were kids. <br>
  In hopes to relieve some of the stress of daily life and to jump back into childhood memories.

## Features:

- ## 16 (4x4) "CARDS"

  - The 16 playing cards light up in 8 different colors.
  - At most there are two of the same color.
  - You can only light up two cards at the same time.
  - If the cards show different colors, they go back to the original black coloration.
  - If the cards show the same color, they'll stay lit up.<br>
